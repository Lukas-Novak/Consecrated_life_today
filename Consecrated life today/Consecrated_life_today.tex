First sample (\emph{n} = 1800, Age: \emph{M} = 46.41, \emph{SD} = 17.4,
Females: 51.28\%) consisted of participants from nationally
representative sample collected in 2016. In this dataset we did not find
subjects responding incongruently to the control items i.e.~feeling the
God presence despite being Non-religious or atheist. Thus, no
participant was excluded from a dataset.

\hypertarget{sample-two}{%
\subsubsection{Sample two}\label{sample-two}}

The second sample was collected in\ldots\ldots\ldots. From the original
dataset (\emph{n} = 1263), we excluded 120 participants who responded
incongruently to 3 repeatedly asked questions and those, who were
speeders i.e.~time spend filling questionnaire was \textless{} 10 min.
The three control questions included age (difference \textgreater{} 2
years), weight and height (difference \textgreater{} 2 kilogram and
centimes). Hence, the number of participants was 1143. Based on the
results of outliers screening procedure (see statistical analysis
secion), we also removed subjects, which responded to large number of
questions in the same way (\emph{n} = 2). Therefore, the final number of
participants was 1141 (Age: \emph{M} = 49.2, \emph{SD} = 16.73, Females:
46.45\%).

\hypertarget{sample-three}{%
\subsubsection{Sample three}\label{sample-three}}

The third sample (\emph{n} = 1662) was collected during May 2021 (zde
moc psl dopln další info). After data were collected, we excluded
participants (\emph{n} = 166) reporting incongruent answers and those
who were classified as speeders. The criteria were the same as in the
second sample. This resulted in 1496 (Age: \emph{M} = 50.67, \emph{SD} =
15.79, Females: 44.05\%) participants. No participant with uniform
responses was detected.

\hypertarget{sample-four}{%
\subsubsection{Sample four}\label{sample-four}}

A sample of Catholic order members in the Czech Republic and in the
Slovak Republic was recruited to take part in a survey regarding various
aspects of today´s consecrated life. The respondents were recruited by
contacting the major superiors of all male and female religious
institutes in both countries. After six weeks, the information about the
survey was sent directly into the local communities in order to increase
the number of respondents. The research was done under the auspices of
the Conference of Major Religious Superiors of the Czech and Slovak
Republic. The superiors were asked to spread an online or a
paper-and-pencil questionnaire among the members of their communities
and to support its completing. Data was collected from March to May
2021. This sample initially consisted of 497 participants. In the first
step, we excluded participants (n = 4) who were classified as speeders
i.e.~finished questionnaire typically lasting more than 30 minutes in
\textless{} 10 minutes. After this exclusion, 493 participants remained.
We also removed participants who filled questionnaire multiple times
(\emph{n} = 63) resulting in (n = 430) of subjects . This sample
consisted of 180 Czech participants and 213 Slovak participants. Other
than Czech and Slovak participants were excluded (n = 37) resulting in
393 subjects (Age: M = 47.52, SD = 9.57, Females: 78.88\%). No uniform
pattern of responding was detected in this sample.

\hypertarget{statistical-analysis}{%
\subsection{Statistical analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}}

As suggested by Shapiro-Wilk test and by histograms, normality
assumption was broken in all samples. Thus, non - parametric methods
were used. Homogenity of variances was equal in all samples as indicated
by the Breusch-Pagan test. As the null hypotheses of the MCAR test in
all our surveys was not rejected, we deleted missing values listwise.
Outliers were explored by the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD). Outliers
identified by the MED were consequently screened and if there were signs
of uniform pattern of responding i.e.~answering the number of items in
the same manner, than outlier were removed from the dataset.\\
To explore differences in health status among clerics and non - clerics,
we compared in logistic regression models long lasting illnesses of
clerics to reported long lasting illnesses of participants from
representative sample. In these models, reported long lasting illness
was was as a dependent variable, grouping variable distinguishing
clerics from non - clerics was regressor and covariates were are,
gender, education and length of a life in clerical order.

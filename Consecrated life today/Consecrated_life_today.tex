\abstract{The study examines the general health of consecrated persons
(CP) in the Czech Republic (CZ) and in Slovakia (SK) compared to control
samples of Czech population. Compared to the previous studies from some
western countries, we expected a higher level of adverse health
affecting factors among CP in post-communist CZ and SK. The sample of
293 CP participants (age: M = 47.52, SD = 9.57, females: 78.88\%, 180
Czechs, 213 Slovaks) was compared with two control samples, one was
nationally representative. Comparing CP with general population, we
measured the frequency of recent health complains, the occurrence of
chronic illnesses, the general health and the individual chronotype. CP
compared to the representative sample had a higher chance of suffering
from small pelvis pain and obesity, but a lower chance of diabetes.
Further, CP had higher odds of having worse general health. Comparing
``larks'' with ``night owls'' among CP, ``night owls'' had a
significantly higher chance of suffering from worse general health.
``Night owl CP'' also seem to suffer more from backache and
depression/anxiety and to have more problems with falling asleep.
Compared to the major society, CP in CZ and SK tend to have a similar or
a slightly worse general health. The results differ from the US findings
pointing at the positive health effects of spiritual experience and
structured daily routine of CP. Thus, this study shows the importance of
more detailed research on the way of life of Czech and Slovak CP to
determine the factors with the most negative health effects.}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Persons who consecrated themselves through their lifelong commitment to
God and to a certain religious institute represent a minority group
belonging mostly to the Roman Catholic Church
\citep{holtz2006geschichte, frank1988geschichte}. This group differs
from the major society in more aspects and its way of life arouses many
questions \citep{cist2019living, elias2019monasticism}. To the main
specifics of living in a religious institute belong the fundamental role
of spirituality \citep{bussing2017validation} and religiosity
\citep{quartier2017monastic}, the hierarchical structured community and
subordination to the authority, the binding statutes and daily routine
\citep{wrobel2018duties, fernandez2019convents}, gender uniformity and
resignation on sexual relationships and family life
\citep{huel2018missionaries}. Expected is also a high level of social
engagement \citep{bickerton2013spiritual} as well as a certain social
isolation and/or self-excluding from the mainstream
\citep{jewdokimow2019transcending, meawad2020sexuality}. Catholic order
members can be regarded as a homogenous population with a number of
common characteristics on individual and socioeconomic level
\citep{bowen2018community}.\\
Research on health among consecrated people (CP) attracts some
attention, but the studies are sparse and rather ambiguous. The majority
of the existing studies brings positive conclusions. The religious order
members were reported to be at lower risk of mental health disorders
\citep{rogowska2020investigating}, more successful in achieving physical
and mental well-being \citep{corwin2014lord} and able to care
systematically for their health \citep{huck1996health}. The prevalence
of positive emotions was observed among the nuns
\citep{skrzypinska2012intricacies} as well as a higher level of personal
happiness \citep{francis2018happiness} and satisfaction at work
engagement \citep{ariza2018work} together with lower tendence to
professional burnout \citep{chirico2020spirituality}. Several studies
chose the religious communities as a sample of people living a
meaningful and cognitive stimulating life and came to the results of
lower risk of Alzheimer disease or dementia among them
\citep{keohane2019nun, schott2019stability}. It corresponds to the
findings about higher ability of consecrated persons to age meaningfully
\citep{corwin2020care} and about their longevity
\citep{weinstein2019autonomous, danner2001positive}. On the contrary, a
few studies point at some deficits in the health practises of religious
order members \citep{meurer1990exploratory}. These deficits can include
a danger of exhausting the spiritual resources through excessive work
engagement \citep{bickerton2013spiritual} or an impact of community
conflicts on the health of individuals \citep{bowen2018community}.
Furthermore, because the daily routine of the religious communities is
usually strongly oriented to getting up early and going to bed early
without considering individual chronotype, we also suppose persons with
a late circadian timing, the so called ``night owls'', being in some
measure handicapped by this regime. As opposite to the ``larks'' with an
early circadian timing, ``night owls'' prefer to stay up and to work
long in the evening and have problems to wake up and to be active early
in the morning \citep{facer2019resetting}. ``Night owls'' living in a
religious community with a structured daily routine might suffer from
lack of sleep, which might have a negative impact on their health
\citep{duns2019sleep}. However, the existing results cannot be fully
generalized, because there is a need of more data from different
countries and social-political contexts. So far, most of the previous
research studies were carried out in the USA, some of them in Poland,
Germany and Italy. In all these countries, in spite of the advanced
secularisation in some of them, the presence and the social engagement
of religious institutes have an established tradition and a high level
of public credit, which seems to play an important role
\citep{rogowska2020investigating}. On the contrary, data from secular
post-communist countries are missing, as well as data from African,
Asian or South American communities. We presume there is also some other
bias to consider, such as a high level of social desirability and
non-representative samples because all community members rarely complete
the voluntary questionnaires and the healthier and more active persons
are more likely to participate. The current study examines the general
health characteristics of religious brothers and sisters in former
Czechoslovakia compared to control samples of the Czech population. As
the country with the highest percentage (76,4\%) of religiously
unaffiliated people in the world (Pew Research Center 2014), the Czech
Republic (CZ) represents a not very supportive milieu towards the Roman
Catholic Church and religious institutes. Slovakia (SK) belongs
traditionally to the Catholic countries (62\% Roman Catholics and 13,4\%
atheists in the 2011 census) and the consecrated persons are more
numerous and more appreciated than in the Czech Republic. Nevertheless,
the modern history of these two countries is firmly connected and the
convents and monasteries in both of them are still carrying the
consequences of the long persecution, overworking and forced isolation
during the communist regime. Compared to the previous studies, given
these facts, we may expect a higher level of adverse health affecting
factors and lower scores of well-being and life satisfaction among the
members of the Czech and Slovak religious communities, presuming some
slight differences between the Czechs and Slovaks. Therefore, the aim of
this study is to explore the possible associations between membership in
a convent or monastery religious community in two post-communist
countries and the general health characteristics of the individuals.
Further, we will assess if the individual chronotype can play some role
in health of consecrated persons.

\hypertarget{measures}{%
\subsection{Measures}\label{measures}}

\hypertarget{health-complaints}{%
\subsubsection{Health complaints}\label{health-complaints}}

The frequency of recent health complaints was assessed by the 6-item
measure: headache, stomachache, backache, intestinal problems, trouble
falling asleep, dizziness. The question was: ``In the past month, how
often have you had the following issues?{}`` Each item was answered on a
five-point scale: never (1), about once or twice (2), approximately once
a week (3), more than once a week (4), every day (5). For analytical
purposes, participants responses were dichotomised. Answers ranging from
1:''never'' up to 3: ``approximately once a week'' were recoded as ``Not
many times per week'' and answers ranging from 4: ``More than once a
week'' up to 5: ``every day'' were recoded as ``Many times a week''.

\hypertarget{long-lasting-illnesses}{%
\subsubsection{Long lasting illnesses}\label{long-lasting-illnesses}}

For the occurrence of chronic illnesses, an 18-item measure was used
introduced by the question: ``Do you have a long-term illness or
disability? Please tick all that apply to you.`` The illnesses are
listed in Table 2.

\hypertarget{general-health}{%
\subsubsection{General health}\label{general-health}}

The general health was assessed by composite variable created by summing
up the number of chronic illnesses. This variable was consequently
divided into several categories based on the following approach: having
\textless{} 1 disease was classified as ``no diseases'', 1-2 diseases
was classified as ``few diseases'' 3-5 diseases as ``several diseases''
and more than 6 as ``many diseases''.

\hypertarget{chronotype}{%
\subsubsection{Chronotype}\label{chronotype}}

The daily energy was measured by choosing between two possibilities --
``an early bird'' (or ``lark'') who wakes up early but is tired in the
evening, or ``a night owl'' who has problem with waking up early but
enjoys working in the evening.

\hypertarget{participants}{%
\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}}

\hypertarget{sample-one}{%
\subsubsection{Sample one}\label{sample-one}}

First sample (\emph{n} = 1800, Age: \emph{M} = 46.41, \emph{SD} = 17.4,
Females: 51.28\%) consisted of participants from Czech nationally
representative sample of the study on health, life experience, attitudes
and lifestyle collected in 2016 \citep{malinakova2020religiosity}. In
this dataset we did not find subjects responding incongruently to the
control items i.e.~feeling the God presence despite being non-religious
or atheist. Thus, no participant was excluded from the dataset.

\hypertarget{sample-two}{%
\subsubsection{Sample two}\label{sample-two}}

The second sample was collected in April 2020. It was a survey made in
the Czech population during the first Covid 19-lockdown. From the
original dataset (\emph{n} = 1263), we excluded 120 participants who
responded incongruently to 3 repeatedly asked questions and those, who
were speeders i.e.~time spent on filling the questionnaire was
\textless{} 10 min. The three control questions included age (difference
\textgreater{} 2 years), weight and height (difference \textgreater{} 2
kilogram and centimetres). Hence, the number of participants was 1143.
Based on the results of outliers screening procedure (see statistical
analysis section), we also removed subjects, which responded to large
number of questions in the same way (\emph{n} = 2). Therefore, the final
number of participants was 1141 (Age: \emph{M} = 49.2, \emph{SD} =
16.73, Females: 46.45\%).

\hypertarget{sample-three}{%
\subsubsection{Sample three}\label{sample-three}}

A sample of Catholic order members in the Czech Republic and in the
Slovak Republic was recruited to take part in a survey regarding various
aspects of today´s consecrated life. The respondents were recruited by
contacting the major superiors of all male and female religious
institutes in both countries. After six weeks, the information about the
survey was sent directly into the local communities in order to increase
the number of respondents. The research was done under the auspices of
the Conference of Major Religious Superiors of the Czech and Slovak
Republic. The superiors were asked to spread an online or a
paper-and-pencil questionnaire among the members of their communities
and to support its completing. Data was collected from March to May
2021. This sample initially consisted of 497 participants. In the first
step, we excluded participants (n = 4) who were classified as speeders
i.e.~finished questionnaire typically lasting more than 30 minutes in
\textless{} 10 minutes. After this exclusion, 493 participants remained.
We also removed participants who filled questionnaire multiple times
(\emph{n} = 63) resulting in (n = 430) of subjects . This sample
consisted of 180 Czech participants and 213 Slovak participants. Other
than Czech and Slovak participants were excluded (n = 37) resulting in
393 subjects (Age: M = 47.52, SD = 9.57, Females: 78.88\%). No uniform
pattern of responding was detected in this sample. The mean duration of
being part of a religious community was 24.45.

\hypertarget{statistical-analysis}{%
\subsection{Statistical analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}}

As suggested by Shapiro-Wilk test and by histograms, normality
assumption was broken in all samples. Thus, non - parametric methods
were used. Homogenity of variances was equal in all samples as indicated
by the Breusch-Pagan test. As the null hypotheses of the MCAR test in
all our surveys was not rejected, we deleted missing values listwise.
Outliers were explored by the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD). Outliers
identified by the MAD were consequently screened and if there were signs
of uniform pattern of responding, i.e.~answering the number of items in
the same manner, outliers were removed from the dataset.

To explore the differences in health status among CP and non-CP, we
compared long lasting illnesses of CP to chronic illnesses of
participants from representative sample in logistic regres-sion models.
In these models, long lasting illnesses were set as dependent variables.
Grouping variable distinguishing CP from non-CP was a regressor.
Covariates consisted of gender, educa-tion and age. Ordinal logistic
regression was used to compare CP and non-CP in the general health. The
same regression type was applied to explore associations between the
chronotype and general health in CP. In the ordinal regression models,
the following variables were controlled: age, education, gender and
length of life in a religious institute. The Brant test indicated, that
pro-portional odds assumption held for each of the ordinal regression
models. Variance inflation fac-tor (VIF) was used to assess
multicolinearity in all regression models. The VIF values \textless{} 10
indicat-ed an acceptable degree of association between variables
\citep{TAY2017}. Bonferroni correction was used to correct p-values in
all regression models. When the significnance was lost after correction,
we used the term ``trends'' to describe relationships after the
correction. The R {[}Version 4.1.0; \citet{R-base}{]} was utilized for
all analysis.

In Table 2, prevalence of chronic diseases among the study samples can
be found. Table 3 presents differences in chronic diseases between
consecrated persons and the representative sample. It was revealed that
there is a significant positive relationship between being a consecrated
person and a lower probability of suffering from diabetes in crude
effect. However, there was a positive relationship between being a
consecrated person and a higher chance of obesity in crude and ad-justed
effect, pain in the small pelvis in both crude and adjusted effect and
thyroid disease in crude and adjusted effect. After Bonferroni
correction, thyroid disease was non-significant.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

The aim of the study was to assess the relation between living as a
consecrated person in religious institutes in the Czech Republic and in
the Slovak Republic and general health. Compared to a Czech national
representative sample, the results showed a lower probability of
suffering from diabetes in CP. However, CP were found to be in a higher
risk of obesity and pain in the small pelvis (women CPs) and they seem
to tend more to thyroid disease. Further, we discovered no significant
results in health complaints of CP in comparison with the control
sample. Only the item ``trouble falling asleep'' in the religious sample
was close to the significance threshold. Moreover, CP had significantly
more chronic diseases. More specifically, when focusing only on CP, we
found a higher risk of suffering from chronic illnesses for ``night
owls'' compared to ``larks'', though only in crude effect. ``Night owl
CP'' seem to suffer more from arthritis, backache and depression/anxiety
and have more problems with falling asleep. The association of being a
consecrated person with higher risk of obesity (table 2) can be
explained by several reasons. According to some findings, higher
tendency to obesity is observed among believers in general
\citep{koenig2012religion}. Further, although there are no specialised
studies in this social group, some general findings can be applied
considering the reality of religious communities. Regarding the
high-performance orientation, enrooted for many decades particularly in
apostolic religious congregations \citep{jakvsivcova2021sluzebnici}, we
can suppose the lack of sport and physical exercise as well as the lack
of sleep, which is often connected with unhealthy eating habits
\citep{narcisse2018mediating}. Furthermore, some religious communities
still tend to follow the old uniforming rules which do not support
individual diets \citep{jakvsivcova2012dcery}. In this case, all members
are supposed to eat the same food, which may not be appropriate for
everybody. The performance pressure is also related with higher level of
stress as another factor leading to unregulated eating
\citep{ling2021relationships, leow2021understanding} and potentially
elevated levels of cortisol, which is further influencing one´s
metabolism \citep{kistenmacher2018psychosocial}. The high-performance
orientation and stress can also contribute to the higher tendency of CP
to suffer from thyroid disease, because chronic stress seems to be one
of the important factors lead-ing to this illness, as reported by
Cremaschi et al. \citep{cremaschi2000chronic}. On the contrary, though a
higher risk of diabetes could be expected among CP due to the already
described higher risk of obesity, which belongs to the main risk factors
of diabetes \citep{brovz2020prevalence}, our results did not support
this presumption. These findings may be explained by the fact that
another factor significantly contributing to the development of diabetes
is smoking \citep{brovz2020prevalence}, which is, however, quite rare
among CP. Women CPs are non-smokers \citep{butler1996trends} and there
is only a small group of smokers among priest and men CPs
\citep{stang2012cancer}. However, more data would be needed to support
this potential explanation. Moreover, we found two or three times higher
risk of the small pelvis pain among religious sisters. There might be
several reasons for this. Life in celibacy includes a higher risk of
psychosomatic complaints caused by libido-suppression and of
psychosexual problems \citep{baumann2019spiritual}. Further, we can
argue that issues regarding sexuality are in some extent still taboo in
religious institutes, because this approach is deeply enrooted in the
mentality of elderly sisters, which also tends to self-denial and
ignoring of health problems \citep{jakvsivcova2021sluzebnici}.
Therefore, it may be challenging for some consecrated women to visit
gynaecologist regularly and to solve the starting complaints soon
enough. According to the latest findings of Nygaard et al.
\citep{nygaard2020baseline}, in case of chronic pelvic pains, early
intervention is important to reduce the complaints successfully. It
remains a task for the future research to study the extent of traumatic
experiences with sexual abuse among CP compared with a sample of
non-CPs, because it might be another possible reason for the chronic
small pelvis pain in CP \citep{heim1998abuse}. Our finding of a lower
general tendency of CP to have sleep disturbance remained close to
significance threshold and more data would be needed to confirm it.
However, religious community members with ``night owl'' chronotype
reported sleep disturbances significantly more often than ``lark CP''.
Looking only at the religious sample, ``night owls'' declared evidently
higher probability to have troubles falling asleep than ``larks''. A
common daily routine in a religious community is strictly oriented to
getting up early and going to bed early, which is favourable for
``larks'' and inconvenient for ``owls'', who have to adapt to this
routine. In some extent, it may be useful for them, because shifting
sleep/wake timings in ``night owls'' to earlier hours showed positive
effects on their performance and mental health, as reported by
Facer-Childs \citep{facer2019resetting}. However, the biorhythm still
might cause difficulties to fall asleep early. As a consequence, some
``owl-brothers/owl sisters'' seem to give up going to bed early and to
continue working late in the evening according to their chronotype, but
they have to respect the regime given and get up early to attend the
community morning prayer. It may result in the chronic lack of sleep in
this group of consecrated persons, possibly leading to other health
issues. Several studies exploring the individual chronotype concluded,
that the definite evening types -- ``night owls'' show higher rates of
metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease and are in higher
mortality risk \citep{knutson2018associations}. Our sample is too small
to discuss this topic, however, it showed some results about evening
types having worse health characteristics. The revealed connection
between being a ``night owl CP'' and a higher risk of depression is
consistent with the general findings about this chronotype
\citep{facer2019resetting}. Furthermore, these CP may be stressed by the
permanent lack of sleep, which can contribute to a development of
depression. The higher backache tendency in ``night owl CP'' may be a
psychosomatic consequence of a higher stress level
\citep{hajnovic2018causal}. A higher risk of arthritis in ``night owl
CP'' does not correspond with the previous findings of Habers et
al.~about rheumatoid arthritis patients showing an earlier circadian
rhythm \citep{habers2021earlier}. However, our sample is not large
enough and we would need more data to check up this potential
assotiation. When comparing Czech and Slovak CP with the Czech
representative sample regarding the general health, we found
significantly higher risk of having worse general health for CP.
Moreover, these findings are supported by a trend, however
insignificant, that could be observable in most of the chronic diseases
in our study. These findings correspond to our hypothesis that comparing
to the results from USA
\citep{schott2019stability, weinstein2019autonomous}, there are more
negative health-effecting factors in CP in CZ and SK. It seems to be
connected with different mentality and lifestyle of CP in the USA and in
CZ/SK, influenced by the major society and the historical, cultural and
ecclesiastical background, especially with delayed and just partial
reception of postconciliar changes after Vaticanum II, which is typical
for the post-communist countries
\citep{fiala2000koncil, balik2012letnice}. The Czech/Slovak CP still
seem to tend to the traditional performance-oriented lifestyle
characterised by strict self-denial \citep{petravcek2013sekularizace}.
Thus, possibly reasons for the worse general health in Czech/Slovak CP
could be overworking, stress and lack of active and passive rest caused
by the stereotyped regime of the communities, unadapted to their actual
situation and not giving enough space for leisure and relaxation of
individuals. Perhaps also higher incidence of psychosomatic problems
could be considered. All these are hypotheses for future research.
Strengths and limitations This study has several important strengths,
the most important is that it is the first study about consecrated
persons living in the specific milieu of two post-communist countries.
The study is based on the first blanket research among CP in these
countries, which is covering many dimensions of consecrated life and
allows to investigate various factors of living in a religious
community. Moreover, as a comparion, this research uses a large
nationally representative Czech sample and another large professionally
gathered online sample close to national charcteristics. Nevertheless,
not having nationally representative data from a Slovak sample
represents a certain limitation of this study. We accept that the
numbers could slightly change if these would be included, as there are
slight differences between Czechs and Slovaks in life expectancy and
prevalence of some chronic illnesses \citep{vagavsova2017disparities}.
Nevertheless, we do not suppose these potential differences changing the
finding that consecrated persons in CZ and SK in our sample seem to have
similar or worse general health compared to the major population.
Another limitation of our study is related to the fact that the sample
of CP is relatively small because of the general mistrust of CP towards
surveys asking personal questions. We can also expect a certain
selection bias in the sample, supposing the more active, more interested
and healthier CP more likely to fill in the questionnaire. However, in
case of this study, this selection bias seems rather to affirm the
conclusion about the lower general health of CP. Implications Our
findings suggest that there is a need for researchers and also for
spiritual directors to focus more deeply on internal structures, daily
routine, relationships, working habits and mental hygiene in religious
communities. These issues should also be discussed directly in the
religious communities and in the courses for religious formators.
Furthermore, doctors, psychologists, counsellors and other helping
professions should be informed more about the lifestyle of consecrated
persons. Future research should be oriented to revealing positive and
negative health effecting factors among CP, comparing CP both from local
communities of one country and from different countries and cultural
contexts, so that generally spread and culturally conditioned factors
can be distinguished.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

According to our findings, compared to the major society, persons living
the consecrated life in the post-communist Czech Republic and Slovak
Republic tend to have a similar or a slightly worse general health. The
results differ from the US findings pointing at the positive health
effects of spiritual experience and structured daily routine. Thus, this
study shows the importance of more detailed research in the way of life
of (not only) Czech and Slovak religious communities to determine
factors that could be contributing to their negative health outcomes.
Ethics statement The study design was approved by the Ethics Committee
of the Olomouc University Social Health Institute (No.~2021/3).
